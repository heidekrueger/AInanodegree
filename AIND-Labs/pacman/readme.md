# AIND - Pacman Search Lab

In this lab, we'll implement some graph search algorithms, most notably A*.


## Setup
This lab requires `python 2` --> create anaconda env for this.

## Solutions
The creator's of the lab do not allow publishing of sulutions. The checked-in version will therefore not contain them in clear text. (`search.py` and `searchAgents.py`).

My solutions score 24/25 points (heuristic for Food Search could be improved.) They are included in the `solutions.zip` file (password protected, on windows, use 7zip to unpack)
