# AIND - Pacman Search Lab

In this lab, we'll implement some graph search algorithms, most notably A*.


## Setup
This lab requires `python 2` --> create anaconda env for this.

## Solutions
The creator's of the lab do not allow publishing of sulutions. The checked-in version will therefore not contain them in clear text.

The solutions will only be commited in a password protected archive.
